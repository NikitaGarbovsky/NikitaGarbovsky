### Awwww G-day Mates

Garbovsky's the name, abstract language is THE game.

### Here is the list of things I do for you to judge my worth:

1. I make the software.
2. I like the philosophy. 
3. I draw pixel's on my computer sometimes.
4. I TRY not to take myself too seriously. Emphasis on try.
5. I am currently attempting to connect 1-4 together into interactive digital experiences. (Video Games)

### Other things about me:

1. I enjoy moving my body in ways so I do not die by age 50.
2. I exclusively eat the stuff that is grown from the ground, not what eat's said stuff, so I again, do not die before age 50.
3. Usually always up for wee chat.
4. Don't get me started on bicycle infrastructure.
5. What bicycle infrastructure you ask? Exactly.
